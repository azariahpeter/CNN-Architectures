# CNN-Architectures
A Race classification which explore all the possible architecture to find the best model available

The models that we will use for this text will be:
- Model_1 : A Random(A control for this test)
- Model_2 : Model with extra layers and methods like Dropout, MaxPooling2D, LeakyReLU etc
- Model_3 : Using VGG16 as convolutional base
- Model_4 : Using VGG19 as convolutional base
- Pretrained models(ResNet, VGG16)

About Dataset:
- The dataset was provided in kaggle with images of humans belonging to 3 races
      Caucasian
      Mongoloid
      Negroid
  - Train and test Data has 1651 and 74 files respectively belonging to 3 classes.
